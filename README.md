## How to Install?

1. Make sure to rename the folder from redm-mdt-main to mdt and then ensure mdt on your resources list. Also disable any other mdt script you are using.
2. Run the user_mdt SQL in your database.
3. Inside sv_mdt on line 15 you will be able to change the job required to use the mdt (default is police, only one job rn).
